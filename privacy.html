        <h3>Viagee Privacy Policy.</h3>
	Viagee requests the Gmail "compose" permissions. It uses this to create Draft messages in the user's Gmail account,
	based on email "send" requests
	by the user from the local desktop or command line, and, optionally, to send those messages to the specified recipient. In
	other cases, a link is determined and opened to view the composed email on the user's browser.
	<p>
	<p>

	To accomplish this, Viagee stores tokens required to authenticate against the Gmail API. These tokens are stored in
	the GNOME Keyring.


	It also stores the last-used sender email address, to offer as a default for future use.
	<p>
	No other personal information is stored or shared, nor is the identified information used or shared beyond what is described here.
